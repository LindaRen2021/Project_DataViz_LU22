# Project_DataViz_LU22
Here is the individual project I did for my online course Data Visualization with R at Lund University in 2022HT.

The project exercised data visualization with various plots on a multivariate dataset called **Airline** from package `Ecdat` in R. This is a dataset that contains 90 observations of a panel of 6 different airlines with 6 variables in the United States from 1970 to 1984 (duration of 15 years).
The aim of this project is to explore this dataset with various plots in attempt to reveal the hidden correlations (patterns) between the variables. None statistical modelling or null hypothesis testing will be conducted in this report since it is outside the scope of this course of data visualization and of this particular project. However we will try to reveal patterns in the plots and comment on the findings.
