# Project_DataViz_LU22
Here is the individual project I did for my online course at Lund University for the course Vidualization with R in 2022HT.
We will be working on a multivariate dataset called **Airline** from package `Ecdat` for this project for course Data Visualization. This is a dataset that contains 90 observations of a panel of 6 different airlines from 1970 to 1984 (duration of 15 years) with 6 variables in the United States.
We will explore this dataset with various plots in attempt to reveal the hidden correlations between the variables. None statistical modelling or null hypothesis testing will be conducted in this report since it is outside the scope of this course of data visualization and of this particular project. However we will try to reveal patterns in the plots and comment on the findings.
